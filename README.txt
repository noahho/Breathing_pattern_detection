The folder SignalProcessingForMachineLearning contains the MATLAB Code to test the results of my paper.
Start DemoMain to train and evaluate the model.
The Datasets are in the folder Dataset. Their numbers in the name correspond to the number in the code.
To adapt the dataset to train or evaluate the model, change the variables in DemoMain (train_subject, test_subject)
If you change the dataset, run DataPreparation and choose the folder of the dataset.
